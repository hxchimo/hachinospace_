  <h3>The Playlist Reflection Activity</h1>

‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Last week, January 5, 2024, we were assigned to view “The Playlist” on Netflix.<br> 
When I was informed of this, I thought, <i>“How can watching a series have any relevant<br> connection to our subject?”</i> 
      But later on, I proved myself wrong. 
      After watching the first <br>episode, I remembered something crucial  I forgot when I asked myself the question.  <br>
      I forgot how a playliststarts with a code, and a code starts with an idea. <Br>
      <br>
      ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Episode 1 introduced me to Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify. In the episode, I <br> learned that he dropped out of college and worked for different companies. He also <br>applied for a job at Google but was soon rejected because he didn't have a college <br>degree. 
      Later on, he founded Advertigo, an online marketing firm that he sold to <br>Tradedoubler. At this point, I pondered about the typical belief of success— <br>that to become successful, one must undergo education and complete college. <br>
      But this was proven wrong by Daniel Ek when he made $1.25 million at the age<br> of 23. 
      Upon knowing this, I was shocked and amazed by his talents, and skills in <br>web development and programming. 
      Especially because during that digital age,<br> resources are limited and technologies are not as developed as it is, presently.<br>
      
      <br>
    
      ‎ ‎ ‎  When the peer-to-peer music service, Napster, shut down, he thought of<br> having an ad-free music service where people could listen to music anywhere,<br> anytime, without paying and downloading to listen. And so, he realized that <br>music piracy is a problem and it can only be solved by providing a better music<br> server, benefitting its listeners and artists. 
      Thus, driven by this thought, he started <br>the idea of Spotify. He and his company cautiously and carefully planned its <br>development over the years. 
      I specifically like the music choices in the episode. <br>I like how they incorporate music according to the scenario because it means a lot <br>in setting the mood and shows how Spotify is heavily influenced by music. 
      <br>
      <br>
      ‎ ‎ ‎    ‎ ‎ ‎ While I was watching, I could not take my attention off the screen. I was 
      <br> impressed and captivated throughout the episode as a Spotify user. Although I<br> use the app almost daily, I have never thought of how it came to be. And now <br>that I knew, I instantly felt interested and began to appreciate  Spotify more.<br>
       From codes as its foundation to creating the play button to having it play smoothly <br>without delay, Spotify became what it is today. 
       It is a well-known music app used<br> worldwide with over 500 million users.<br>

       <br>
    
      Overall, the first episode is fascinating and quite entertaining to watch. <br>The way it ends makes us, the watchers, excited to know what happens next. I <br>liked it so much that when we exited the computer lab, I immediately thought <br>that it was unlike any other. 
      I realized how codes can be made into something <br>as great as Spotify with proper determination, knowledge, and skills, for it <br> to work and become functional.
